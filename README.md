Computer Science 330, Computational Graphics with OpenGL.  


How do I approach designing software?
I would say that my approach to designing software is analytical- though I like to jump right into the work to get a barebones working prototype before fleshing things out.  Throughout this course, the code has actually lined up with these preferences perfectly, as they guides and tutorials, as well as the starter code has skipped a lot of the hassle.  I really enjoy solving difficult problems, like putting together pieces of a puzzle, and I think this is reflected in my approach to software design.  

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I think that in the context of this course, my work will be useful in game development.  As soon as I started the course, I was immediately reminded of my time working with Unreal, Godot, and Unity; having the knowledge of the inner workings of computational graphics will be paramount in understanding and developing new features in my future endeavors in game development.  

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The 7 weeks of work more or less boil down to a process of building blocks within a scene.  Starting basic and simple, just shapes, then a couple complex shapes, a few colours, textures, materials, lights, and, well, then you have a full scene of complex objects with lots of details.  It's similar to the design philosophy of OOP.  

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
It's applicable wherever object oriented programming is- small steps with concrete, achievable goals, building upon previous iterations and work.  Certain design methodologies might not line up with this, but I'd wager that at least the majority of the skills I've developed throughout this course are applicable in most situations.  

How do I approach developing programs?
In exactly the same way as I do the software design process.  This portion of development, program development, is where the challenge begins, and the unique approaches to problems comes in handy.  

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I'm not sure that I developed any new strategies, but I certainly dug up plenty of old, forgotten, or underutilised and underlearned ones that I've picked up along the way.  I was fairly familiar with the process already, fortunately.  This course has helped me to exceed my existing knowledge though in various ways.  

How did iteration factor into your development?
As mentioned previously, each week, we built upon the previous work.  We improved our scene one step at a time, by implementing incremental, small, but signficantly impactful changes each time.  

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I think the biggest roadblocks were unrelated to the code, and it certainly taught me to begin what I'm going to call "pre-work" before I would normally start the work.  There were often times ridiculus errors that had little to do with the code itself that I was writing, and getting past the setup stage of the assignment was universally the most difficult.  Once I had things running, it was straightforwards and easy enough to complete.   

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My dream job is game development; computer science is essential knowledge for a game dev to both debug, and to innovate within the industry.  

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I think that there might be opportunity to integrate all the skills I have acquired across multiple classes into one; as has been done with other classes tha use mongo, or web development, for example.  I hope to see this computational graphics course culminate in a larger project that combines one or two other project types in the future.  

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I think I have described the benefits of CS-330 enough in previous sections.  Game development is my path forwards, and a deep understanding of computational graphics is essential to success and innovation in the future for me.
